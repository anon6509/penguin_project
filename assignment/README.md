My code for question 2 can be found in the 'share_assignment.pdf' file which is a knitted rmarkdown document, or as an rmd file in 'share_assignment.rmd'. The full project (Q1-3) can be found in 'penguin_assignment.rmd' for the r code or 'penguin_assignment.pdf' for a knitted document. 'cleaning_a.R' has some functions used in the share_assignment code for cleaning and subsetting the data. 'data_a' is a folder with the raw and clean data saved as files. 'figures_a' has the exploratory and results plots saved as png files which are explained in more detail in the share_assignment file. Enjoy!
